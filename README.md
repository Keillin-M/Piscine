# 42 Piscine
A collection of exercises and projects completed during the 42 Piscine — the intensive programming bootcamp preparing students for the 42 curriculum.

## 📚 Overview
This repository contains solutions and work for various Piscine challenges. It includes C programming exercises focused on fundamental programming concepts like variables, control flow, functions, memory management, and algorithms.
The Piscine is designed to build a strong foundation in programming logic, problem solving, and C language skills.
**These are the files I submitted during my piscine, not necessarily all of them are correct, make sure to test and write you own codes!**

## 📁 Structure
The repository is organized into folders by day or topic, for example:
```bash
/Day01 - Basic syntax and functions
/Day02 - Pointers and arrays
/Day03 - Memory management and strings
/Day04 - Recursion and algorithms
/Day05 - Final projects
```
Each folder contains relevant `.c` and `.h` files along with any test files or Makefiles.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Basic C syntax and control structures
- Functions and recursion
- Pointers and memory allocation
- String manipulation
- Algorithms and problem solving
- File handling and I/O

## 🔧 How to Compile
Each project or exercise usually includes a Makefile or can be compiled using:
```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror filename.c -o output_name
```
Replace filename.c with your source file(s).

##📌 Notes
- Follow 42 coding style guidelines in all projects.
- Code is typically tested with provided Piscine testers or custom test scripts.
- This repository is a personal reference and study tool; it’s recommended to understand and rewrite code yourself.
